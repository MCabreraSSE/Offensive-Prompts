Investigate the domain behind this URL as a threat hunter: <URL or DOMAIN>

Provide:
- Registrant/age heuristics (newly registered? likely disposable?)
- DNS posture: A/AAAA, MX, TXT/SPF/DMARC, NS patterns, fast-flux signs
- Certificate/TLS hints (issuer, validity, SANs) and what to pivot on
- Similar domains / typosquat possibilities (what to look for internally)
- Recommended detections (SIEM queries ideas)
Output as:
1) Key Observations
2) Pivots (what else to search for)
3) Detection Opportunities
4) Recommended Response
