Your task is to analyze a driver DriverName.sys in IDA Pro. You can use the MCP tools to retrieve information. In general use the following strategy:

Analyze the provided driver code focusing on:
1. Exposed IOCTLs (Input/Output Control) - identify opcodes
2. Missing or insufficient input validations
3. Possibilities of buffer overflow (stack or heap)
4. Arbitrary memory read/write operations
5. Token/privilege manipulation
6. Exposed function pointers that can be overwritten
7. Race conditions
8. Use of dangerous functions such as memcpy, strcpy without validation

Specifically look for:
- Accessible process/thread handles
- Operations with EPROCESS/ETHREAD structures
- Access to arbitrary PID/TID
- Ability to read/write kernel memory
- Registered callback functions that can be manipulated
- Control of function pointers through exposed structures

Create a PoC that exploits the vulnerabilities found for:
a) Privilege escalation (SYSTEM/NT) AUTHORITY)
b) Denial of Service (system/driver crash)
c) Arbitrary kernel memory read
d) Arbitrary kernel memory write

Analysis format:

1. Identify all IOCTLs and their functionalities
2. Map data structures and parameters
3. Identify missing validations
4. Develop exploit primitives
5. Build a complete exploit
